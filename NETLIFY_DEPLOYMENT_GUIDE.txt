🎯 HOW IT WORKS:
================

1. USER VISITS WEBSITE:
   → Static HTML files served from Netlify CDN (super fast!)
   
2. PRODUCTS PAGE:
   → JavaScript calls /.netlify/functions/products
   → Netlify function fetches from Blobs database
   → Products displayed on page

3. ADMIN LOGIN:
   → You enter credentials
   → JavaScript calls /.netlify/functions/auth
   → Function verifies against environment variables
   → Session created (24 hours)

4. ADDING PRODUCT:
   → You upload image & details
   → JavaScript calls /.netlify/functions/products (POST)
   → Function saves to Netlify Blobs
   → Product appears on products.html automatically

💾 DATABASE (NETLIFY BLOBS):
=============================

- FREE tier: 1 GB storage
- Fast global distribution
